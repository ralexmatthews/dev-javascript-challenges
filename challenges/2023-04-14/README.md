# Design a Weather Page

[Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/) provides a free API to get weather data. Using whatever technology you like, use this API to design a single-page weather application. Feel free to do whatever you want with the data it provides, but it looks like the free tier provides:

- [Current Weather Data](https://openweathermap.org/current)
- [5 Day/3 Hour Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)
- [Weather Maps](https://openweathermap.org/api/weathermaps)
- [Air Pollution](https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution)
- [Geocoding](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api)

Or you can sign up for the free 1-call 3.0 API, but that requires putting billing info in, which I'd rather not, so I will not be lol

Be creative (or don't be. I'm not your mom). This shouldn't be too too difficult, but might take a few hours. If you don't feel like writing your own interface for dealing with this API, I couldn't find an NPM package that does it, but feel free to copy my implementation, and just focus on making the UI. Or if you just feel like doing the API implementation, you can just copy my UI.

**NOTE:** Remember not to commit API keys to the repo. I have added `.env` to the `.gitignore`, so you can use that or pass it in directly.
